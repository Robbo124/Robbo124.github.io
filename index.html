    <h1> Hello! </h1>

    Welcome to my website, I am a freshman at Umaine Orono majoring in business. I like hiking, snowboarding and the outdoors. If you want to

work somewhere that I can be outdoors. I enjoy listening to music and hanging out with my friends. Some of my favorite things: </P>

<p> <b> Why I came to Umaine </b> </p>
<p> I decided to come to umaine because I have been coming to Maine since I was a child to snowboard in the winter and go boating in the summer.
 Maine is my favorite state, and I one day hope to live here. Click <A HREF="cv.html">here</A> to see more pictures of Maine. My favorite part
  about Maine is the variation between summer and winter, which allows you to do many different activities in all sorts of conditions.
  I also love the mountains and State parks, like Acadia and Baxter. </p>
<p> <b> More about me </b> </p>
<p> I enjoy listening to music, specifically indie rock. Some of my favorite bands are:

<LI> The Smiths </LI>
<LI> The Church </LI>
<LI> The Talking Heads </LI>
<LI> Van Morrison </LI>
<LI> Pavement </LI>
