<p><b>About me </b></p>



<P> Welcome to my website, I am a freshman at Umaine Orono majoring in business. I like hiking, snowboarding and the outdoors. If you want to
    read more about the outdoors and hiking, click <A HREF="hiking.html"> here</A>. I am from Hopkinton Massachusetts, which is near Framingham. I went to Hopkinton Highschool and graduated in 2018. One day I want to
    work somewhere that I can be outdoors. I enjoy listening to music and hanging out with my friends. Some of my favorite things: </P>

<p> <b> Why I came to Umaine </b> </p>
<p> I decided to come to umaine because I have been coming to Maine since I was a child to snowboard in the winter and go boating in the summer.
    Maine is my favorite state, and I one day hope to live here. Click <A HREF="cv.html">here</A> to see more pictures of Maine. My favorite part
    about Maine is the variation between summer and winter, which allows you to do many different activities in all sorts of conditions.
    I also love the mountains and State parks, like Acadia and Baxter. </p>
